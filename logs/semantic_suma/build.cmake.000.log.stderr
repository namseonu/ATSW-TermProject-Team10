CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.16/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:275 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /catkin_ws/src/semantic_suma/CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGTSAM.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM" with any of
  the following names:

    GTSAMConfig.cmake
    gtsam-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GTSAM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GTSAM_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GTSAM"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
